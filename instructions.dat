<span class="instructionssubheading">Finding the Numbers</span>
<li>There will be 7 randomly generated numbers of the 21 numbers on the dartboard (bullseye = 25).</li>
<li>Each player will take their turn by throwing three darts one at a time.</li>
<li>The player will then click on the numbers that were hit on the digital dartboard.</li>
<li>If the number is one of the 7 random numbers, the number opens and counts as a hit; otherwise, it is a miss.</li>
<span class="instructionssubheading">Closing the Numbers</span>
<li>If a number that has been opened is hit three times by a player, that player has closed that number.</li>
<li>Players who have closed a number cannot receive points on that number.</li>
<li>Players who have not closed a number can receive points on that number.</li>
<span class="instructionssubheading">Scoring on Others</span>
<li>Players can give others points by hitting an open number after they have closed it.</li>
<li>Players who have not closed that number will receive that number of points.</li>
</ol>
<ol class="t01">
	<span class="instructionssubheading">Reducing the Numbers</span>
		<li>Each player will take their turn by throwing three darts one at a time.</li>
		<li>The player will then click on the numbers that were hit on the digital dartboard.</li>
		<li>The score for that player will reduce by the total number hit by the darts.</li>
	<span class="instructionssubheading">Closing Out</span>
		<li>A player can only close their score to 0 by hitting a double (outer ring).</li>
		<li>If a player closes by hitting other than a double or goes below 0 (bust), their score will return to what it was at the beginning of their turn.</li>
